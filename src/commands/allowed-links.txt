Be careful using links in your message. I am extremely judgemental and give timeouts at the drop of a hat.

<b>1. Root Domains and All Subdomains (Api3 and General Platforms)</b>

The URL must start with one of the following protocols and domains, or its protocol-less equivalent, and can include any path on that domain and all of its subdomains:

     - https://api3.org/ 
     - https://youtube.com/
     - https://github.com/ 

Examples: 

     - https://api3.org/
     - https://docs.api3.org/
     - https://dao-docs.api3.org/overview/governance.html


<b>2. Official API3 Social/Community Profiles (Specific Paths Only)</b>

The URL must start with one of the following exact paths, or its protocol-less equivalent, to ensure it points only to the official profile and not other pages/subdomains on that site:
     - https://x.com/api3dao
     - https://twitter.com/api3dao
     - https://medium.com/api3 
     - https://t.me/API3DAO
