Links will almost surely get you a timeout, see allowed links using the command /allowedlinks

I use AI to review messages. If you are ignoring the rules:
 - Your message will be deleted
 - You get a 24 hour timeout
Then an admin will review your message resulting in one of the following actions:
 - Forever timeout, read only member
 - Permanent ban, cannot rejoin
 - Kicked out, you can rejoin
 - Private warning from an admin (a second chance)
 - Remove timeout, repost your message with an apology
