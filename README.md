# api3-telegram-bot

There are two Api3 groups in Telegram. In Telegram a group is sometime called a chat or chat group.

- Api3 - public with invite URL
- Api3 Administrators - private

This bot drives AI processing of Telegram messages. The AI prompt determines if a message violates the Api3 group rules. The rules are publicly available, the AI prompt is not. Other features include keyboard actions in the Api3 Administrators group for the following:

- Timeout 24 hours
- Timeout forever
- Clear timeout
- Restore message

## Documentation

Documentation for development will be available when the new `api3-social-docs` repo is ready.
